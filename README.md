# UTM distro support
This is a list of Linux and Unix distributions that start on UTM, the virtualization program for Mac with Apple Silicon M and Iphone.
The idea of the project is to map all the working distros within the environment creating a stable and reliable environment.

|       OS       |      Arch     |   version  |    status   |   UTM       |   product     |   Host OS    |
|----------------|---------------|------------|-------------| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
|     Debian     |     arm64     |     11     |      â˜‘      |  4.0.6 beta | mbpro m1 8gb  |  13 Ventura  |


## What are the main problems of UTM?
- Guest additions sometimes do not go or do not perfectly recognize the resolution used by the host system at that moment.
- Sometimes distros don't boot from live cd or iso image.
