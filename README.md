# UTM distro support
This is a list of Linux and Unix distributions or other os that start on UTM, the virtualization program for Mac with Apple Silicon M and Iphone.
The idea of the project is to map all the working distros within the environment creating a stable and reliable environment.

- â˜‘ works out of the box;
- âš  it works but is not very stable;
- ~ in testing right now;
- ðŸš« It does not work.

## What are the main problems of UTM?
- Guest additions sometimes do not go or do not perfectly recognize the resolution used by the host system at that moment.
- Sometimes distros don't boot from live cd or iso image.
