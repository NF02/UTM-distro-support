# Ubuntu 22.04
- all the main functions work, from audio to video and also the shortcuts and special keys.
- Sometimes there are obvious glitches on GNOME and it doesn't quite manage to integrate guest additions;
- for unknown reasons the distro can give a differently pleasant "EFI stub: ERROR: FIRMWARE BUG: kernel image not aligned on 64k boundary"
